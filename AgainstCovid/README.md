# AGAINST COVID-19
Game developed in partnership with Vitor Lima and Rafael Azzolini. Due to the worldwide situation of the new Coronavirus pandemic, this game was developed in order to raise awareness among users.

## What is the project?
It is a game with menu, settings options and player name personalization, based on choices, where each one takes different paths,
as well as a system of lives.

## How it works?
The game has three difficulty levels, in addition to a selection menu, another for choosing background colors, and a space for entering the name
of the Player, about the difficulty levels are: An isolation in
home, a merchant who owns a store, and doctors who are on the line
fighting Coronavirus.
Each level has apparently normal situations, but which lead to
varied paths, if the user chooses the most appropriate option the phase
otherwise, a “life” is discounted from the 3 available and then the
player advances to the next level with one less life.

## For whom and what is it for?
The main proposal was to create a game that can entertain the user,
designed to be used by anyone, has the purpose of
provide an awareness of the situations, and their risks on the
current scenario of the country and the world in the face of the pandemic.
Although it is a game that has the purpose of fun, it is
Respect for everything that happened and happens, and the lives that were
lost in this Coronavirus epidemic.

## Program Coding in Language C
The program works with IF functions and checks, in addition to vectors
for name storage, and loops for the operation of the
lives and another options like the loop if the player don't write the corret answer.
